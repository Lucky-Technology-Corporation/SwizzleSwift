#Swizzle

Add this repo to your project and get started with `Swizzle.shared.configure(projectId: "YourProjectID", test: false)`. The `test` parameter is true by default.

The test environment is separate from the production environment (database, logs, authentication, etc). Your changes in one will not affect the other. 

You can read the rest of the docs [here](https://www.notion.so/Swizzle-e254b35ddef5441d920377fef3615eab?pvs=4).
