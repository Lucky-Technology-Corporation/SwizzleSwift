# Swizzle

Add this repo to your project and get started with `Swizzle.shared.configure(projectId: "YourProjectID", test: false)`. 

The test environment (true by default) is separate from the production environment. Your database, logs, authentication, and other changes in one environment will not affect the other. 

You can read the rest of the docs [here](https://www.notion.so/Swizzle-e254b35ddef5441d920377fef3615eab?pvs=4).
